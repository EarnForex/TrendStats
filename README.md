# TrendStats

TrendStats is a custom MetaTrader script that collects and calculates various trend-measuring indicators on a given range of symbols and timeframes and summarizes its finds in several CSV-files. It was coded by EarnForex.com for MT4 and MT5.

Its main purpose is to provide a tool for an in-depth trend analysis of various currency pairs and other symbols.
